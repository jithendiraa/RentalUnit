                         The term “house rules” might sound authoritarian, but that does not have to be the case. Simply put, it is actually just a more professional way of explaining to your guests what they may (and may not) do during their stay. Generally, you will want to include in your house rules list arrangements and requests about the check-in process,
					   noise levels, pets, parking, and the checkout procedure. It does not have to be all formal and serious. After all, your guests are reading it before a vacation. So, if you want to, you can make it more fun. 

At the end of the day, your guests just need to know what is expected from them and have complete clarity over what behavior could land them in trouble (and potentially result in a fine, or, even worse, eviction). Ideally, whenever possible, try to write the rules in such a manner that it informs guests what they may do,
 rather than what they may not do.
