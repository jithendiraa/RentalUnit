                       The term “house rules” might sound authoritarian, but that does not have to be the case. Simply put, it is actually just a more professional way of explaining to your guests what they may (and may not) do during their stay. Generally, you will want to include in your house rules list arrangements and requests about the check-in process,
					   noise levels, pets, parking, and the checkout procedure. It does not have to be all formal and serious. After all, your guests are reading it before a vacation. So, if you want to, you can make it more fun. 

At the end of the day, your guests just need to know what is expected from them and have complete clarity over what behavior could land them in trouble (and potentially result in a fine, or, even worse, eviction). Ideally, whenever possible, try to write the rules in such a manner that it informs guests what they may do,
 rather than what they may not do.Before you settle in, I would like to make you familiar with a few of the most important house rules at our vacation rental. These are in place to ensure that your stay with us will be as comfortable as possible. Your guests expect that they will have to do a few light chores, especially if you charge a cleaning fee. So, it is appropriate to include rules about cleanliness and how they should dispose of garbage.
